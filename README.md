# Section 1 CPSC 350
# Worked with Vinny Caffaro


#  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4981197/2d-array-values-c
#  Also recieved help from James Kistner, Junior Data Analytics major at Chapman

#  Good stuff
#  I did finish all of Classic Mode, along with 'Pause' 'Enter' and 'Output file'
   display options for the user. Also I was able to read in a file and use the 
   files rows, columns, and density to create a new grid. As well as taking in
   user input for custom demensions if they so desired

#  Bad stuff
#  I was not able to finish Dounut Mode becase I was getting segmentation errors
   with my game function
#  I did not attempt Mirror Mode


#  Overall
#  I put wayyyy to much time into this project but when I finally got classic
   mode working I felt amazing, definitely super cool.
